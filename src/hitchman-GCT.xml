    <description>
        <p>Motivated by questions in cosmology, the text investigates hyperbolic, elliptic, and Euclidean geometry - three possibilities for the global geometry of the universe.</p>
        <p>It is written for students who have taken vector calculus, and intended to be suitable as a one-semester course or as a guide to independent study in non-Euclidean geometry and the geometry of surfaces.</p>
