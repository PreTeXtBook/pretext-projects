    <description>
        <p>This is an open source textbook designed to teach the principles and theory of abstract algebra to college juniors and seniors in a rigorous manner. Its strengths include a wide range of exercises, both computational and theoretical, plus many nontrivial applications. Rob Beezer has contributed complementary material using the open source system, Sage.</p>

        <p>The first half of the book presents group theory, through the Sylow theorems, with enough material for a semester-long course. The second-half is suitable for a second semester and presents rings, integral domains, Boolean algebras, vector spaces, and fields, concluding with Galois Theory.</p>
    </description>

    <onesentence>
        A standard two-semester introductory course in abstract algebra covering groups, rings, and fields,
        plus other topics including Galois theory,
        featuring computations and nontrivial applications.
