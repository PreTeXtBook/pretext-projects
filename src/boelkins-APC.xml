        <em>Active Prelude</em> is designed for a preparatory course for students not yet ready to take calculus; it is especially suited to students who will later study from <em>Active Calculus</em>.
    </onesentence>

    <description>
        <p><em>Active Prelude to Calculus</em> is designed as a college-level preparatory text for students who aspire to take calculus and who either need to take a course to prepare them for calculus or want to do some additional self-study. In particular, the text is intended as an appropriate prerequisite base for students who will go on to study from <em>Active Calculus</em> while also encouraging and promoting an active learning approach. The HTML version of the text includes about 150 anonymous, interactive exercises; static versions of those problems are included in PDF and print. In addition, the text offers about 120 activities designed for student engagement in and out of class.  Learn more at <url "https://activecalculus.org/APC.html">.</p>
