        <i>Active Prelude</i> is designed for a preparatory course for students not yet ready to take calculus; it is especially suited to students who will later study from <i>Active Calculus</i>.

    <description>
        <p><em>Active Prelude to Calculus</em> is designed as a college-level preparatory text for students who aspire to take calculus and who either need to take a course to prepare them for calculus or want to do some additional self-study. In particular, the text is intended as an appropriate prerequisite base for students who will go on to study from <em>Active Calculus</em> while also encouraging and promoting an active learning approach. The HTML version of the text includes about 150 anonymous, interactive exercises; static versions of those problems are included in PDF and print. In addition, the text offers about 120 activities designed for student engagement in and out of class.
