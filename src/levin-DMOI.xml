    <description>
        <p>A free, open source textbook appropriate for a first or second year undergraduate course for math majors, especially those who will go on to teach.  Also appropriate for an introduction to proofs course with discrete content.  </p>
        <p>Four main topics are covered: counting, sequences, logic, and graph theory. Along the way, proofs are introduced, including proofs by contradiction, proofs by induction, and combinatorial proofs. An introductory chapter covering mathematical statements, sets, and functions helps students gain familiarity with the language of mathematics, and two additional topics (generating functions and number theory) are also included.</p>
        <p>While the book began as a set of lecture notes, it now contains a number of features that should support its use as a primary textbook:
          <ul>
            <li>473 exercises, including 275 with solutions and another 109 with hints. Exercises range from easy to quite involved, with many problems suitable for homework.</li>
            <li>Investigate! activities throughout the text to support active, inquiry based learning.</li>
            <li>A full index and list of symbols.</li>
            <li>Consistent and helpful page layout and formatting (i.e., examples are easy to identify, important definitions and theorems in boxes, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </description>
