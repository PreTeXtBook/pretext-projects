        This is an IBL problem set designed to introduce a student to euclidean, hyperbolic, and projective geometry from axiomatic and transformational approaches.

    <description>
        <p>This text was designed for an IBL approach to MATH A305 Introduction to Geometries at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Its purpose in the mathematics baccalaureates at UAA is to cover geometry topics required for secondary teacher certification. As a result it covers synthetic, transformational, and a tiny bit of analytic approaches to geometry and covers both Euclidean (parabolic), hyperbolic, and some projective geometry.</p>
        <p>Students are expected to have completed a proofs course covering proof techniques, basic set operations, and cardinality as a prerequisite. The students have typically taken high school geometry. </p>
