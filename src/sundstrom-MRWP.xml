    <description>
        <p>
          <i>Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof</i> is a text for the ﬁrst college 
          mathematics course that introduces students to the processes of constructing 
          and writing proofs and focuses on the formal development of mathematics. Version 3 of 
          this book is almost identical to Version 2.1. The main change is that the preview 
          activities in Version 2.1 have been renamed to beginning activities in Version 3. 
          This was done to emphasize that these activities are meant to be completed before 
          starting the rest of the section and are not just a short preview of what is to 
          come in the rest of the section.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary goals of the text are to help students:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Develop logical thinking skills;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                develop the ability to think more abstractly in a proof-oriented setting;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                develop the ability to construct and write mathematical proofs using 
                standard methods of mathematical proof including direct proofs, proof by 
                contradiction, mathematical induction, case analysis, and counterexamples;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                develop the ability to read and understand written mathematical proofs;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                develop talents for creative thinking and problem solving;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                improve their quality of communication in mathematics, which includes 
                improving writing techniques, reading comprehension, and oral communication 
                in mathematics;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                better understand the nature of mathematics and its language.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Another important goal of this text is to provide students with material 
                that will be needed for their further study of mathematics.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Important features of the book include: Emphasis on writing in mathematics; 
          instruction in the process of constructing proofs; and an emphasis on active learning.
        </p>
