        Textbook for a typical one semester course in Differential Calculus, seen through the lens of history.
    </onesentence>

    <description>

        <p> This text will cover all of the <q>usual</q> topics in the typical first semester course in Calculus, as taught in American colleges. However the topics are arranged to reflect the history of the topic, rather than its logical structure in order to use history to illuminate the progression of ideas and concepts. The current version is being written in LaTeX. However the authors will be starting a conversion to PreTeXt in the near future. The text will be published under a Creative Commons license by the Open SUNY Textbook (OST) program and projected to be completed no later than December&#xa0;2020.</p>

        <p>Warning: The version at the URL above is the authors' working draft, not a final version. It is thus subject to change without notice.</p>
