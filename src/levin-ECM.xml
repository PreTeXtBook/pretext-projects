        <p>
          <em>Exploring Combinatorial Mathematics</em> is a free and open source textbook suitable for an upper level undergraduate or Master's level discrete math or combinatorics course, especially if the intended audience is pre-service or in-service secondary teachers.  The text borrows material from Bogart's <em><a href="http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/">Combinatorics through Guided Discovery</a></em> and Levin's <em><a href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/">Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction</a></em>, falling somewhere between these in terms of difficulty. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This book was written specifically to be used as the textbook for the Master's level Discrete Mathematics course at
          the University of Northern Colorado. This course is part of a MA in Mathematics with a Teaching Emphasis. Most of the
          students in the course are current secondary math teachers. This intended audience has influenced the style and
          content of the book in a few important ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we acknowledge that not everyone reading this book will be immediately familiar with the content of a standard
          undergraduate discrete mathematics course. Little is assumed about the reader's previous work in the subject, beyond a
          general understanding of how abstract mathematics proceeds, as well as some basic ability with mathematical proof. For
          the reader completely unfamiliar with these and the basic objects of mathematical study (sets and functions),
          background material is included in an Appendix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Topics have been selected to illustrate larger concepts of interest to secondary teachers. We have put an emphasis on
          understanding simple concepts deeply and in more than one way. Although some topics intersect secondary curriculum,
          most of the questions here are at a higher level. Still, the problem solving strategies and big ideas illustrated by
          our questions have applications to secondary mathematics. This emphasis is quite different than other mid level
          discrete and combinatorics textbooks, since we are not preparing our readers to begin a career in research
          mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this course is not a course on teaching mathematics, we have tried to model good pedagogical practice. As you
          will see, almost all of the textbook consists of <em>Activities</em> and <em>Exercises</em> that guide students to
          discover mathematics for themselves. This will require quite a bit more work both from students and instructors, but
          we strongly believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics. Most of all, discovering
          mathematics is fun.
