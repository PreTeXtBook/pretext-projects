    <description>
      <p>This free, online text is designed for a one-semester undergraduate mathematics course that combines an introduction to group theory with an introduction to modern geometries using the Kleinian paradigm.</p>

      <p>The chapter on groups develops the basic theory of groups and homomorphisms, culminating with group actions. The chapter on geometry makes use of group symmetries in the basic theory of Möbius, hyperbolic, elliptic, and projective geometries.</p>

      <p>The text is designed for active engagement, with carefully structured exercises throughout.</p>

      <p>The text assumes prerequisite courses in calculus, linear algebra, and experience with proof writing.</p>
