    <description>
      <p><em>Understanding Linear Algebra</em> is an open-source,
      open-access textbook designed for use in a one-semester
      introduction to linear algebra that does not assume calculus as
      a prerequisite.  There is an emphasis on conceptual thinking,
      motivating applications, and computation using the open-source
      software <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a>.  The text
      supports active learning by including preview activities and
      several in-class activities for each of its 22 sections.</p>
      <p> Material for a second semester follow-up course is in
      development and will be published in May 2020. </p>
