    <description>
        <p>The purpose of Sound Writing is to help you develop a range of techniques that you can use to succeed as an academic writer. As you'll soon discover (if you have not discovered already), academic writing is a practice with its own conventions and expectations. Academic inquiry is about using the best possible evidence to grapple with contested issues. Academic writing places special emphasis on rigorous use of evidence to substantiate claims, on clear and specific theses, and on the framing of arguments within scholarly contexts. These traits distinguish academic writing from most popular writing (the type of writing that one finds on blogs, in newspapers and magazines, and on Facebook). Though it is possible to discuss <q>academic writing</q> as a coherent entity, academic writing is also diverse and reflects writers' own personal, disciplinary, and sub-disciplinary biases. (Take a look at the example student essays included in the Resources section of this book.) In Sound Writing, we hope to provide you with the essentials of university writing so that you can write with as little stress and as much success as possible. Inside this book, you'll find a breakdown of research, composition, and revision processes; strategies for overcoming common writing challenges; advice from faculty members; a guide to APA-, Chicago-, and MLA-style citations; and much more.</p>
