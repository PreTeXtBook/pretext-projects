            To promote mathematics among Indigenous learners, we have created a series of stories with mathematical themes.
            These stories are based on the storytelling tradition of Indigenous peoples.
            The fact that most of our stories have been translated into several Indigenous languages
            as well as French is probably the biggest recognition that an author could hope for.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first story, <pubtitle>Small Number Counts to 100</pubtitle> was inspired
            by narration from Ms.<nbsp/>Rina Sinclair of the Siksika Nation.
            The story can be shown to elementary school students as a counting practice/puzzle or as a pattern recognition problem.
            For high school students it can be a way to introduce arithmetic progressions,
            modular addition, or an idea of number systems with a base different than <m>10</m>.
